# tap-project2

Welcome to the tap Project! Upon landing you'll notice a black screen, looks like fun right? However upon each letter that you hit, a sound will be played as well as a random colored circle that fades into the screen. It's not made for anything special, just a fun JavaScript project. It also uses howler to play the sounds
